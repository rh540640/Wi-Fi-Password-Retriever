# Wi-Fi-Password-Retriever
Retrieves the saved Wi-Fi passwords from a Linux system using the nmcli tool.

To use the script, save it to a file (e.g. wifi-password-retriever.sh) and make it executable using chmod +x wifi-password-retriever.sh. Then, run the script using the command ./wifi-password-retriever.sh. The script will retrieve the saved Wi-Fi passwords from the system and display them in the format "Wi-Fi network: SSID, Password: PASSWORD". Note that the nmcli tool must be installed on your system for the script to work.
